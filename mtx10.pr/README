             HOW TO TEST PRINTER DRIVER

1. Run mk to generate a MTX bootable FD image

2. Under QEMU:
   qemu -fda FDimage -no-fd-bootchk -parallel /dev/pts/2   # use a PTS terminal

3. Under VMware: Configure VM with
   FDimage as floppy drive; connected at power on 
   A parallel port = a file

Boot up MTX from FDimage, run  pr command from User Mode.
